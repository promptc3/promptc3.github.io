Today I stumbled upon this ![status update](/assets/img/whatsapp-1.png)
which really got me thinking what are these gaps they are talking about.
In my opinion I believe I've taken a gap of a year or two in my short existence
on this planet and would like to share my experience on what I think a gap should be.

First of all a gap shouldn't be like a story of a rich hipster, who spends
his day in pursuit of finding something he is "passionate" about by doing
absolutely nothing. Because that asshole could afford to do nothing and
survive in this 21st century. We all want to find something we are
passionate about but the correct way to accomplish that would be to do it
and figure out you were wrong. Because you may end up hating the very
thing you thought you loved. Yep!! A surprise and not a welcome one.

It certainly should be a break from your regular work to try out
something unconventional or may be conventional. You should have a clear
objective of what you want to accomplish. True for any day.
It doesn't matter what your age is, whether you are a student or a
veteran. You will be considered unemployed. That's a fact. Deal
with it. Don't expect sympathy and help. Don't expect success at the
end. You may fail.

And it is fine if you want to prepare for a competitive exam,
something I did and I'm satisfied. It is great if you take a gap to
build your software or game, again something I did. It would be
breathtaking if you took a gap to build a caf√© racer, something I wish
to do. It would be legendary if you took a gap to serve for a local NGO.
Something you should do. It would be exhilarating if you took a gap to
climb a mountain. Do share the pics. And what if you took a gap to spend
time on your uncle's farm and discover farming is really what you want to do.
Now that's some story I would love to hear.

But you ought to remember a few things. It's not reserved for
polymaths at MIT. You the most average person on earth can do it. It's
not a tour to Europe with friends and family on a two week vacation.
That's a break, a vacation, not a gap. And your dad is not obliged to
support it. You need to take into account the pros and cons, safety
and security and how you plan to put food on your table.

That said I hope you consider taking one.
